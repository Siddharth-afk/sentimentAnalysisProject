# sentimentAnalysisProject
Sentiment analysis project (final year project)

In this project we'll be looking at tweets specific to a particular stock and determining using sentiment analysis whether that stock would be going up or down. As social media plays a big role in our society, we should also be aware of its influences in the stock market. With our project, you'll be able to see whether public opinion about a stock or a company can lead to the stock increasing or decreasing in value.

What more do we plan to add? well:
1. A front end where you'll be able to see graphs and predictions
2. comparisions against traditional stock market prediction algorithms
3. more fine tuning
